;;; The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is:
;;; 1^2 + 2^2 + ... 10^2 = 385
;;;
;;; The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is:
;;; (1 + 2 + ... 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
;;;
;;; Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is
;;; 3025 - 385 = 2640 
;;;
;;; Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
