;;; Experiments in calculating loan schedules from algebraic expressions
;;; Uses a very simple algebraic library I have created maths.algebra
;;; 
;;; This library is an enhanced version of maths.loan-schedule2. It adds support for:
;;; (1) If the interest due between (disbursement-date â†’ first-pay-date) can not be
;;      paid off in the first instalment: 
;;      We do not capitalise this interest. 
;;      We just carry it forward and pay it off first from the monthly instalment until there is no longer any outstanding interest.
